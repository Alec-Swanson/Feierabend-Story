Just a city boy, born and raised in South Berlin, he took the midnight train going anywhere!
A singer in a smokey room, a smell of Apfelkuchen and cheap perfume, for a Doener they can share the night, it goes on and on and on and on!
Strangers waitin', up and down the Hauptstrasse, their shadows searchin' in the night.
Streetlights, people Livin' just to find Brot Hidin' somewhere in the night.
Workin' hard to get my Schloss, Everybody in Raesfeld wants a thrill.
Payin' anything to roll the dice just one more time; some'll BMW, some will Porsche, Rammstein are born to sing the blues.
