Just a city boy, born and raised in South Berlin, he took the midnight train going anywhere!
A singer in a smokey room, a smell of Apfelkuchen and cheap perfume, for a Doener they can share the night, it goes on and on and on and on!
Strangers waitin', up and down the Hauptstrasse, their shadows searchin' in the night.
